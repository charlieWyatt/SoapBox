1. Dependencies: Both the client and server will share dependencies such as React, React-Native, Expo, TypeScript, Prisma, tRPC, and Yarn.

2. Exported Variables: Both the client and server will have exported variables. For example, the client might export components like Tweet, UserProfile, Feed, and ComposeTweet. The server might export models like Tweet and User, and services like tweetService and userService.

3. Data Schemas: The server will define data schemas for Tweet and User in Prisma. These schemas will be used by both the client and server.

4. ID Names of DOM Elements: The client will have ID names for DOM elements in the components and screens. For example, there might be IDs for elements in the Tweet, UserProfile, Feed, and ComposeTweet components, and in the HomeScreen, ProfileScreen, ComposeScreen, LoginScreen, and RegisterScreen.

5. Message Names: The client and server might use message names for communication. For example, the client might send a "createTweet" message to the server, and the server might send a "tweetCreated" message to the client.

6. Function Names: Both the client and server will have function names. For example, the client might have functions like createTweet, deleteTweet, createUser, and deleteUser. The server might have functions like createTweet, deleteTweet, createUser, and deleteUser in the tweetService and userService.

7. API Endpoints: The server will define API endpoints in the tweetRouter and userRouter. These endpoints will be used by the client to communicate with the server.

8. Environment Variables: The server will use environment variables defined in the .env file. These might include database connection details.

9. Seed Data: The server will use seed data defined in the seed.ts file to populate the database for testing.

10. tRPC APIs: The server will define tRPC APIs in the tweetAPI and userAPI files. These APIs will be used by the client to communicate with the server.
